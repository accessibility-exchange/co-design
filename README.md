# Trivet

## A simple starter kit for Eleventy-based static sites for the Fluid Project

This repository contains the files needed to build [Eleventy](http://11ty.dev/)-based static sites for the [Fluid Project](https://fluidproject.org).

## Usage

### To run locally in development mode

1. Install the required NPM packages: `npm install`
2. Run [Eleventy](http://11ty.dev) in development mode: `npm start`.

The website will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### To build and serve using Docker

You can build and serve the website from a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) container.

Once you have Docker installed, run the following commands to build a Docker image and start a container:

* Build the image: `docker build -t trivet .`
* Run the container: `docker run --name trivet -p 8000:80 trivet`

The website will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

If you make changes to the website, repeat the steps to build the image and start a new container.

### To build for deployment to a personal web server

1. Install the required NPM packages: `npm install`
2. Run the build script: `npm run build`
3. Upload the contents of the `./dist/` directory to the web root of your server.

If you make changes to the website, repeat step 2 to build the website and upload any changed files from the `./dist/`
directory to the web root of your server.

## Features

* Integrated [UI Options](https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/UserInterfaceOptionsAPI.html) Preferences Editor.
* Basic static site configuration for developing project websites and blogs.

## Notes

Modifications can be made to any source file or directory except for the contents of the `./dist/` directory. The
`./dist/` directory is not versioned since it contains the built website that Eleventy generates from the source files,
and  files in `dist` are overwritten at build time.
