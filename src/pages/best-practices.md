This document contains best practices for how to respectfully engage people with disabilities and Deaf people, as identified by co-design participants.

## Always ask - don’t make assumptions

* There is incredibly diversity within different disability communities and cultural communities

* Individuals with the same disability may not have the same access needs and they may need completely different access support
* Disability is not experienced in a static way and it depends on a large number of factors and it can be in flux
* A person’s outwards appearance may not reveal the type of support they need
* Indigenous communities are incredibly diverse and each may want to be approached differently

* Start over every time you enter a new community or interact with a new person - wipe the slate clean from any assumptions. First sit down and ask questions, and listen:

* What are your access needs? What accommodations do you need?
* How do you like to communicate?
* What technology is accessible for you?

* If you plan to engage with a community, talk to the community groups and nonprofits working with that community to ask questions and better understand that community

## Reflect on your position in the world

* To prepare, do some self reflection on what it means for someone with more privilege in life to prepare themselves for this process. What do you know? What do you not know yet?
* Understand what it is to decolonize language, practices, and worldview when working with Indigenous communities and communities of colour

## Meet people where they’re at

To make things as accessible as possible, try to meet where people are at in a variety of different ways. For example:

* Go into the community where people are, instead of asking people to come out. For example, long term care homes that tend to be disconnected from the rest of the community.
* Use the language that people use - whether that be Sign Languages like ASL, LSQ, or ISL, or a language that is not English or French. Provide interpretation and translation. This can also include the way you communicate, like using plain language instead of technical jargon.
* When hiring a translator or interpreter, make sure they have the expertise for the particular area you’re discussing. For example, a medical interpreter.
* Use technology that people already have access to, or can afford
* Use the way of interacting that people prefer (ex. Pre-recording video vs in-person meeting)
* Go at a pace that the other person prefers (ex. If they need extra time to make a decision or respond)
* Communicate directly with people with significant disabilities - provide extra support if necessary - instead of solely communicating with their supporters
* Include supports for consultants who are non-verbal, or have barriers articulating their thoughts easily, and people who are not comfortable using the language used for the consultation
* Have facilitators from your consultants’ communities, people they can relate to and share experiences with.
* Ask questions to help you meet the consultants where they are at:

* “How can I best serve you as your (bank, etc)?”
* “What annoys you?”
* “What makes you feel excluded when you walk into a business?”
* “What are you looking for, what do you need?”

## Tackle consultation fatigue

* Consultation fatigue happens when people have been repeatedly consulted, but no change comes from it - or they don’t know what happened to their feedback.
* To avoid giving your consultants consultation fatigue, be transparent: communicate and share progress with people who have consulted with you, and what you are implementing and what you are not

## Be cautious about safety and privacy

* Take extra care when asking for sensitive information, especially for people with significant disabilities
* Since disabilities can be invisible, some people may come off as understanding what you are saying when they do not, and need a supporter to help with communication
* If you are meeting someone online or over the phone, take extra care that there’s no one overhearing your conversation on either end
* When hiring interpreters, take extra care that the person may not be coming from the same small community as consultants.
* Make the use of pronouns optional - asking pronouns may force someone to come out before they are ready

## Frame your work using the social model of disability

* The medical model says that there is a deficit with people with disabilities and that they need to be fixed, whereas the social model recognizes that it is the environment or attitudes that are disabling
* When framing your work, communication, or mindset around accessibility and inclusion work, many people with disabilities consider the social model of disability as respectful and appropriate
