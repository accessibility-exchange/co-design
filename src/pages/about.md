Accessibility in Action is a two-year initiative managed by the Institute for Research and Development on [Inclusion and
Society (IRIS)](https://irisinstitute.ca/) with a diverse project leadership team and implementation partners and
advisors – including disability organizations with local-to-national reach, individuals representing marginalized
communities (i.e. Indigenous, racialized, migrant, 2SLGBTQ+) as well as technical and legal experts.

Accessibility in Action sets out to create an online platform that will bring disability communities together with the
thousands of organizations or entities who are regulated under the Accessible Canada Act of 2019. The initiative aims to
help deliver on the legislation’s immense potential to mobilize effective engagement of people with disabilities and
federally-regulated entities in creating an accessible and inclusive Canada that fully respects and protects the human
rights of people with disabilities.
