This service blueprint describes what a meaningful consultation process looks like based on our co-design participants’ input, what activities are required to support this process, and who provides it.

{% callout "How to read this document" %}

There are two sections to this document: Who’s involved, and what’s happening.

This document focuses on the consultant and the entity, and the process that they are going through from beginning to end. Everyone else is supporting those two groups.

You can read starting from the beginning. Or, you can pick a specific person or step that’s happening that you want to learn more about.
