Accessibility in Action sets out to create an online platform that will bring disability communities together with the
thousands of organizations or entities who are regulated under the [Accessible Canada Act of
2019](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/accessible-canada.html). The initiative aims to
help deliver on the legislationâ€™s immense potential to mobilize effective engagement of people with disabilities and
federally-regulated entities in creating an accessible and inclusive Canada that fully respects and protects the human
rights of people with disabilities.
