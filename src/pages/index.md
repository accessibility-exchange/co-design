Accessibility in Action sets out to create an online platform that will bring disability communities together with the
thousands of organizations regulated under the [Accessible Canada Act of
2019](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/accessible-canada.html). The initiative aims to
facilitate effective engagement of people with disabilities and federally-regulated entities in creating an accessible
and inclusive Canada that fully respects and protects the human rights of people with disabilities.

This website documents the co-design and development process of the Accessibility in Action project, and is maintained
by the [Inclusive Design Research Centre](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/).
