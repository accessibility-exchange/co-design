      **Outreach team**


      * Use data gathering tools to find out which communities are under-represented in the process, and therefore who to do outreach with

      * Support the building of constituency groups, find potential representative consultants, and potentially do more outreach for that constituency group 

      * Receive requests for walkthroughs, determine how to make the walkthrough accessible, and schedule them


      **Disability organizations**


      * Disability organizations receive communication material from IRIS or the social enterprise

      * Come up with outreach strategy catered for their members’ and their communication needs, to look for consultants and representative consultants
  - title: Support activities
    subtitle: Provide any resources or structures for frontline activities to happen
    content: >-
      Social enterprise


      * Outreach team should be trained in inclusive outreach, cross disability, intersectionality

      * Create communication materials for everyone to use

      * Provide software licenses that help with promotional efforts

      * Have a help centre to assist potential consultants, outreach team, and disability organizations to answer any questions about the process, and navigate the website

      * Develop guidelines/requirements around constituency groups and verifying representative consultants
  - title: Potential barriers
    subtitle: ""
    content: >-
      *  Not everyone has the same resources or methods of connecting

      *  Reaching out to the most systemically excluded members of an already systemically excluded group

      *  Misinformation and disinformation, especially among groups with communication barriers

      *  Internalized beliefs about who a “consultant” is

      *  If there’s only one member in a community doing outreach, there can be limits of reach

      *  Language may be a barrier, both in terms of using the same language, as well as using plain language

      *  Many disability community members have consultation fatigue

      *  Consultants have other higher priority issues, like meeting basic needs
