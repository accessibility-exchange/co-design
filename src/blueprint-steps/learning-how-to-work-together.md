    subtitle: Activities that the consultants and entities are being directly involved in
    content: >-
      * Consultants receive detailed project orientation by Federally Regulated
      Entity/third party convener

      * Consultants and Federally Regulated Entities/third party convener determine how to work together (ex. their starting point, communication methods, consultation process, timeline, access accommodations, ownership of ideas, how to create a safe environment, and how to handle conflicts)

      * Federally regulated entity or third party convener provides consultants with contracts like a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). Consultants have access to legal support to understand, customize, and negotiate the contracts 

      * Entities and consultants can decide whether to move forward or not

      * Consultants can connect with each other to learn about the strengths, expertise, and lived experience each person brings
  - title: Frontline activities
    subtitle: Activities of frontline staff and stakeholders that directly support
      the consultants/ and entities’ experience
    content: >-
      **Social enterprise**


      * Send a list of the consultants’ access needs to the entities ahead of time

      * Work with federally regulated entity to make sure all communication materials and contracts are in accessible formats 

      * Help set up and facilitate accessible meetings between entities and consultants

      * Provides legal resources or advisory to help consultants navigate the contract

      * Make sure the consultation process is ethical and equitable

      * If a consultant decides to leave, work with them to see if any issues can be resolved. If not, assist them in the leaving process and do an exit interview

      * Refer consultant to another project, and refer entity to another consultant
  - title: Support activities
    subtitle: Provide any resources or structures for frontline activities to happen
    content: >-
      **Social enterprise**


      * Document who is leaving the process, why, what sorts of projects they are leaving

      * Use this data and feedback to troubleshoot and/or alter the matching process

      * Create accessible and plain language templates for contracts and legal documents

      * Update the project status on the website that consultants have been matched and confirmed

      * Add this project to the consultants’ page
  - title: Potential barriers
    subtitle: ""
    content: >-
      * Equitable pay - make sure consultants are compensated for their time up
      until they leave the process, instead of at the end of the process to
      prevent power dynamics of money

      * Need to make sure that if entities are declining to work with a particular consultant, it is for a valid reason

      * Failure or a incompatible match can discourage consultants from trying again

      * Consultants may need some legal protections, such as liability protections / insurance

      * How do we make sure the matching process is iterated on based on consultants’ and entities’ experiences?

      * What if there is one entity or type of project that consultants are consistently leaving?

      * Navigating complex legal language in project descriptions and contracts

      * Attitudinal barriers against people with cognitive and psychosocial disabilities

      * Entities won’t be able to support an accessible consultation process

      * Entities won’t be able to share sufficient information about their project due to confidentiality

      * Entities have inflexible or short timeline
