  - title: What's happening
    subtitle: Activities that the entities are being directly involved in
    content: >-
      * Entities do an assessment for their disability awareness and readiness
      to engage

      * Social enterprise recommends training, resources, and service providers to entities and third party conveners 

      * Entity connects with their third party convener and onboards them on their project 

      * Entities and third party conveners complete required trainings and engage service providers for baseline accessibility accommodations to be able to be matched with any consultants
  - title: Frontline activities
    subtitle: Activities of frontline staff and stakeholders that directly support
      the entities’ experience
    content: >-
      **Social enterprise**


      * Work with other disability organizations in developing a disability knowledge and awareness assessment criteria, and a readiness to engage criteria - and assess entity based on that

      * Do training, and recommend resources, and service providers

      * Add resources to the resource library
  - title: Support activities
    subtitle: Provide any resources or structures for frontline activities to happen
    content: >-
      **Social enterprise**


      * Verify which entities and third party conveners have received training, are ready to consult, and have certification, and make sure it shows up on their page

      * Work with other disability organizations in developing and curating training and resources for entities, including white papers and case studies
  - title: Potential barriers
    subtitle: ""
    content: >-
      * Disability organizations may have private training materials

      * Disability organizations may not have the capacity to be involved in developing training material and resources

      * If entities are able to pick who they receive training from from a “marketplace” of trainers, bigger organizations who regularly do this may have more opportunity than smaller organizations just starting

      * If a disability organization provides training to an entity, are they able to provide critical feedback on their accessibility plan and consultation process later?

      * If a disability organization provides critical feedback, does that reduce their chances of being hired for training?

      * Entities may already have their own accessibility training processes

      * Entities may not have time and resources to complete the website training

      * Ensure training extends beyond immediate team members from the entity who are involved
