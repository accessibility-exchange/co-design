      completed

      * Social enterprise and advisory committee receive the consultation request and follow up with entities for any details or clarification

      * Social enterprise sends consultation request to a short list of consultants in a medium that is accessible to them. Consultants can accept, or opt out.

      the consultants/ and entities’ experience

      **Social enterprise and Advisory Committee**


      * Review the consultation request from the entities

      * Review the shortlist of consultants that the website produces based on basic criteria (ex. location, compensation, etc.) and finalize the list of potential consultants based on their interest for certain entities or areas of ACA, previous experiences, goals, skills, expertise, and compatibility from previous matches

      * If the entity has consulted with a group previously, gauge the group’s interest

      * Find opportunities to match consultants who want mentorship

      * Provide support to consultants on understanding the project info, in order to accept or opt out of the request

  - title: Potential barriers
    subtitle: ""
    content: >-
      * Distributing projects equitably, not just to those who appear more
      “qualified” than others

      * Potential power dynamic if large professional disability organizations are in the same group as individual consultants

      * Potential conflicts of interest between entity and disability organization, or entity and individual that needs to be considered during matching

      * Potential for duplication and inconsistent information if multiple entities in the same industry are doing consultation with different groups of consultants

      * Potential for duplication and inconsistent information if consultants are starting from scratch and unaware of the work done for other similar companies

      * Getting an interpreter who is qualified in a particular subject matter or area
