    subtitle: Activities that the consultants and entities are being directly involved in
    content: >-
      
      * Entities check in with consultants to see if their access needs have changed

      * Consultants work with entities / third party convener on their accessibility project, potentially with the help of caregivers and support people–consultants and entities can meet multiple times to refine feedback and plan

      * Caregivers consult with the consultant’s circle of care, if there is one 

      * Consultants can connect with each other, with other consultants, and with the advisory committee or panel of experts for support and mentorship

      * Representative consultants check in with their constituency group, gather their feedback through comments and direct quotes, and report back
  - title: Frontline activities
    subtitle: Activities of frontline staff and stakeholders that directly support
      the consultants/ and entities’ experience
    content: >-
      **Social enterprise**


      * Support entity to prepare for the consultation (ex. activities, and questions, format)

      * Support entity or third party convener with accessible communication materials

      * Connect consultants who need equipment or space to a disability organization 

      * Make sure the consultation process is ethical, safe, and equitable

      * Ensure each side is fulfilling their role and responsibilities

      * Check in with the constituency group to see if the representative consultant has gotten their feedback

      * If a consultant decides to leave in the middle of the process, make sure they are paid fairly for their time and contributions
  - title: Support activities
    subtitle: Provide any resources or structures for frontline activities to happen
    content: >-
      **Social enterprise**


      * Update project progress on the website and display project status including which consultants are working on the project, completion status/timeline

      * Upload any additional material shared for consultation (videos, stories, documents, etc.)

      * Build templates and forms for accessibility plans (consider creating an automated process for filling it out)
  - title: Potential barriers
    subtitle: ""
    content: >-
      * Some consultants may feel pressure and power dynamic to appease the
      entities and tell them what they think they want to hear - having a
      community facilitator instead of having the entity facilitating could
      alleviate that

      * Entities may not be able to create a safe and accessible environment for consultation. As a result, consultants may leave the process before it’s completed

      * Consultants may feel the need to pause the process, or to leave altogether. Make sure the consultant is compensated up until they need to pause or leave

      * Making sure that the comments and feedback the constituency group shares remains in context and is not misrepresented

      * Making sure that the representative consultant actually gets input from their constituency group

      * Entities may need help or training to understand the different ways consultants are able to express themselves - they may have difficulty turning consultants’ feedback into actionable results

      * Entities usually have rushed deadlines that may not match the consultants’ pace of working

      * Finding a time that works for different schedules and cognitive abilities (many people can’t be expected to show up in the middle of a workday)

      * Linguistic challenges for those who need time to prepare in advance or experience stress

      * Zoom can be overstimulating and difficult for those with neurodiversity
