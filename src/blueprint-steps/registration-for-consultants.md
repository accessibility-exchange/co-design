      **Social enterprise**


      * Create paper forms and phone registration processes

      * Create database for anyone helping consultants register to enter information into

      * Have a help centre to assist 

      * Use data analytics to track who is successfully registering and who isn’t on the website, and reach out to those who haven’t successfully registered to see if assistance is necessary
  - title: Potential barriers
    subtitle: ""
    content: >-
      * Disability organizations need to have enough capacity to support their
      members to register

      * Some disability organizations do not have the community’s trust, and their involvement may alienate a portion of the disability community

      * Disability organizations may say they work with and advocate for a certain community, but that community may disagree or have had bad experiences with them

      * If disability organization or IRIS/social enterprise registers on behalf of the consultant, how do we manage privacy? (ex. passwords) And how do we make sure people aren’t making extra profiles that werent’ requested to be made by consultants?
