subtitle: Support individual consultants and representatives to build a full
  profile about themselves

## Ideas

### Include a wide range of qualifications

* Lived experience
* Expertise and skills
* Recent consultation work (including volunteer work)
* Areas of interest

### Specify if they’re representing a group

* Which group they represent 
* Who makes up their constituency

### Include accessibility information

* Pace of working
* Communication needs (ex. reminders)
* Communication modes (ex. email, call)
* Their support person
* How they’d like to be compensated
* Any representative they trust to represent them

### Facilitate profiles in multiple formats

* Allow people to use multiple formats to explain the type of work they do, ex. video, audio, ASL, LSQ, ISL
