## Ideas

### Have representatives, who community members trust to speak on their behalf

* They may be support workers, or from a supporting organization, or from the community themselves

### Representatives are trained about issues from the community

### Representatives know how to do outreach intersectionally

### Representatives should have a constituency of people they are accountable to

### Representatives should have a clear model for distributing the compensation among community members
