## Ideas

### Have representatives, who community members trust to speak on their behalf

* They may be support workers, or from a supporting federally regulated entity, or from the community themselves
* They can represent a single person or a group

### Representatives are aware and trained about issues from the community

* For example, have a way of identifying and dealing with issues of control from a personâ€™s family member or caregiver

### Representatives know how to do outreach intersectionally to people in their community they want to get input from

### Representatives should have a constituency of people they are accountable to

* Get verification from consitutency group that the representative consultant has been approved by them
* References from constituency group
* A third party can contact them to check 
* Create compensation model among people being represented
