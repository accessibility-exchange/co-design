## Ideas

### Neutral third party facilitates safe exit process for the consultant

* Attempt to resolve a conflict before consultant leaves the process first

### Data tracking

* Keep track of who is leaving the process, and why
* Keep track of what sorts of projects consultants are leaving
* Use this data to improve matching or training for federally regulated entities
