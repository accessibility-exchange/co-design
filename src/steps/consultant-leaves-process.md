subtitle: Consultant can leave if the process isnâ€™t working out, or if there is
  an issue for them
phase: Consultation

## Ideas

### Have a process supporter troubleshoot before an exit happens

* Neutral third party, like a project manager, to resolve the situation if possible

### Data tracking

* Keep track of who is leaving the process, and why
* Keep track of what sorts of projects consultants are leaving
* Use this data to improve matching or training for federally regulated entities
