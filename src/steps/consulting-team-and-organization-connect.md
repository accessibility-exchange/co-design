step: 10

## Ideas

### Consultants get together on their own to learn about each other

* Strengths, expertise, disabilities, lived experiences
* Connect with each other on what they want to communicate and say so one doesn’t feel the pressure to cover everything 
* Connect with a panel of experts or community of other consultants for support and mentorship

### Design the consultation together - how can federally regulated entities effectively enable the participation of consultants

* Federally regulated entity has a conversation with the consultants about:

  * How to best start the process
  * How to best engage them
  * What makes them comfortable
  * What resources they need to be supported (ex. software licenses, note-taking services,  support people, etc)
  * What happens if the feedback is interrupted for unforeseen reasons
* Create a code of conduct to reflect these agreements, and how to work together respectfully
* Federally regulated entities can also do some of this work beforehand by asking community groups and nonprofits
* Have a process support person to make sure the consultation process is ethical and equitable 

### Provide detailed orientation of the project

* Making sure consultants are fully aware of:

  * The terms of participation
  * Timeframe
  * Goals
  * Responsibilities
  * Other collaborators on the project
  * How their feedback will be acted upon

### Evaluate the “fit” between federally regulated entity and consultant

* Based on this, the individual consultants can determine whether they are the best person for this project
* Federally regulated entities can (in some circumstances) identify that a consultant might not be appropriate for their project (ex. if there’s a conflict of interest)

### Work together to determine a process on how to manage conflict and exits

* If consultant cannot continue for unforeseen reasons
* If consultant needs to leave the process
* If there is discrimination happening based on gender, sexual orientation, race, etc
* Make sure everyone is informed about these processes from the start

### Consultants give informed consent

* Based on everything shared, consultants need to give informed consent to participate
* Have legal resources and supports to customize and negotiate contracts

### Pay consultants as they go

* Pay consultants along the way, up until they leave the process - rather than at the end, to prevent power dynamics of money
* Ex. Initial stipend or holding fee
