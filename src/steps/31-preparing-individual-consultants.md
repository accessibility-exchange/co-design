## Ideas

### Include both people with disabilities and caregivers



### Facilitate people’s identification of their skills and expertise



### Allow for many ways to share

* A classic resume and bio
* Sharing a story about their work, or impact they’ve made in their community, to demonstrate their expertise, ex. video

### Data tracking

* A transparent mechanism to track data of who is signing up, and which groups are underrepresented
