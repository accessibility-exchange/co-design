## Ideas

### Provide transparency about the project

* Background and motivation for the project
* What the goals are
* What the organization wants out of this process
* Timeframe
* Limitations
* Resources that are available to support the consultants
* What benefits consultants can get from this organization (ex. compensation)
* What they’re willing to change or do to respond to feedback (and what resources are available to make changes)
* Who will be impacted by this project, and in what way
* Specific communities they want to engage, and why

### Provide a way for consultants to ask more questions about the project

### Once federally regulated entities shares their project goals, recommending  similar past projects, best practices, and resources

* To not reinvent the wheel
* Potentially consult with the same group of consultants as others in their sector

### A glossary of roles to understand who’s involved in the process
