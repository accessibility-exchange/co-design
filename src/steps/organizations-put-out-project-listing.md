## Ideas

### Provide transparency about the project

* What the goals are
* What the organization wants out of this process
* Timeframe
* Limitations
* Resources that are available to support the consultants
* What benefits consultants can get from this organization (ex. compensation)
* What theyâ€™re willing to change or do to respond to feedback (and what resources are available to make changes)
* Who will be impacted by this project, and in what way

### Provide a way for consultants to ask more questions about the project
