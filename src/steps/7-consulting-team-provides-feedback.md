subtitle: Consulting team and organization work together on their accessibility plan.

## Ideas

### Provide multiple options for consultants to engage, not just one

* Options for time: Don’t require real-time feedback to avoid time pressures
* Options for medium: people to respond in things like video, voice note

### Organizations need to be flexible and transparent about their communication

* Organizations need to communicate to consultants through their preferred medium
* Organizations need to communicate the timeframe of when they’ll respond

### Use community facilitation

* Have facilitation come from someone that the consultants can relate to, or from their own community - this provides more authentic answers, and may help with consultants feeling pressured to say what they think organizations want to hear

### Using stories to express experiences

* People have already had experiences with organizations regarding their accessibility
* Tell stories about those experiences to the relevant organizations, ex. the process of getting a passport

### Organizations ask questions that meet the consultant where they’re at

* “How can I best serve you as your (bank, etc)?”
* “What annoys you?”
* “What makes you feel excluded when you walk into a business?”
* “What are you looking for, what do you need?”

### Have access supporters help consultants articulate their feedback

* For non-verbal consultants
* For consultants who encounter barriers in articulating their thought processes easily
* For newcomers and people who don’t speak the language used

### Have checks and balances to make sure the process is equitable

* Neutral third party, like a project manager, to be involved through the process and provide support
* Make sure safety and well-being of the consultants are met
* Have safety features and a quick exit for the consultation

### Develop follow-up plan together

* When follow up will happen
* How they’re going to implement feedback
* Who is responsible for implementing feedback
* How to reach out for updates
