  Accessibility Plan, and make sure nothing is missing.
phase: Consultation
step: 12

## Ideas

### Create an opportunity for follow-up

* Consultants come back here to look through whatâ€™s been done and offer feedback

### Assess the quality of consultation

* This can be done by another group or panel with cross-disability perspective
* Who was involved, and how many consultants
* Is the feedback comprehensive enough
* How much time was given for responses
* Are there any perspectives missing?
