## Ideas

### Create an opportunity for follow-up

* Consultants come back here to look through whatâ€™s been done and offer feedback

Assessment criteria for quality of consultation

* Who was involved, and how many consultants
* Is the feedback comprehensive enough
* How much time was given for responses
* Are there any perspectives missing?
* This can be done by another group or panel with a cross-disability perspective
* This can be done by consultants outside of the initial consulting team, and they can provide feedback too
