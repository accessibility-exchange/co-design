## Ideas

### Be able to see the reputation of an federally regulated entity from the communityâ€™s perspective


* Consultants will be more or less eager to consult with federally regulated entities depending on their reputation within the community
* See the ways they are currently incorporating their learning about disability into services and programs

### Be transparent about their readiness to change level

* If an federally regulated entity is not ready to change, then consultants are less eager to work with them

### Be transparent about their internal knowledge level



### Be transparent about what the federally regulated entity has done around accessibility



### Be transparent about the other accessibility-related projects your federally regulated entity is doing, and the progress there
