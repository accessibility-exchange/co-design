## Ideas

### Be able to see the reputation of an organization from the communityâ€™s perspective


* Consultants will be more or less eager to consult with organizations depending on their reputation within the community

### Be transparent about their readiness to change level

* If an organization is not ready to change, then consultants are less eager to work with them

### Be transparent about their internal knowledge level



### Be transparent about what the organization has done around accessibility



### Be transparent about the other accessibility-related projects your organization is doing, and the progress there
