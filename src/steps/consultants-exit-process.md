## Ideas

### Do an exit interview to understand where the mismatch was

* Understand from the consultant why they felt like this project wasn’t a good fit
* Alter matching process to take in this feedback

### Data tracking

* Keep track of who is leaving the process, and why
* Keep track of what sorts of projects consultants are leaving
* Use this data to improve matching or training for organizations
