## Ideas

### Include consultants in implementation

* Involve them or hire them to help implement changes from within

### Consultants should be able to see:

* What has been done by organizations after receiving feedback
* How feedback has impacted their different services
* What feedback has not been turned into action yet and why
* What feedback has not been considered and why

### Data tracking

* How much of the feedback the organization has taken and implemented
* Have a way of tracking how much impact we are having
