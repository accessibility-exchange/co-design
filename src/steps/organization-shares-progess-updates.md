step: 14

## Ideas

### Entities can showcase their progress

* Through events like an annual convention, or inclusion week
* Have 1 year, 2 year, and 5 year follow-ups of the impact

### Before entities come back for another round of consultations, check in on their progress


* See what theyâ€™ve been able to put into action since the last round of consultations

### Include consultants in implementation

* Involve them or hire them to help implement changes from within
* Include consultants and others in the sector in implementation
  Involve them or hire them to  help implement changes from within
  Consultants can recommend others in the accessibility sector - ex. occupational therapist, personal assistants, tech workers versed in accessibility

### Consultants should receive implementation updates

* What has been done by federally regulated entities after receiving feedback
* How feedback has impacted their different services
* How feedback has changed company policy
* What feedback has not been turned into action yet and why
* What feedback has not been considered and why
* Consultants can provide feedback on how well the implementation has gone



### Format of follow up

* Make sure report is easy to comprehend 

### Data tracking

* How much of the feedback the federally regulated entity has taken and implemented
* Have a way of tracking how much impact we are having
