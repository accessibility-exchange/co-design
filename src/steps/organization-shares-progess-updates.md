## Ideas

### Include consultants in implementation

* Involve them or hire them to help implement changes from within
* Include consultants and others in the sector in implementation
  Involve them or hire them to  help implement changes from within
  Consultants can recommend others in the accessibility sector - ex. occupational therapist, personal assistants, tech workers versed in accessibility

### Consultants should receive implementation updates

* What has been done by federally regulated entities after receiving feedback
* How feedback has impacted their different services
* What feedback has not been turned into action yet and why
* What feedback has not been considered and why

### Format of follow up 


* Make sure report is easy to comprehend 

### Data tracking

* How much of the feedback the federally regulated entity has taken and implemented
* Have a way of tracking how much impact we are having
