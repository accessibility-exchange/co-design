## Ideas

### Provide multiple options for consultants to engage, not just one

* Options for time: Don’t require real-time feedback to avoid time pressures
* Options for medium: people to respond in things like video, voice note

### Using stories to express experiences

* People have already had experiences with federally regulated entities regarding their accessibility
* Tell stories about those experiences to the relevant federally regulated entities, ex. the process of getting a passport

### Have access supporters help consultants articulate their feedback

* For non-verbal consultants
* For consultants who encounter barriers in articulating their thought processes easily
* For newcomers and people who don’t speak the language used
* Include a way to specify which feedback is from the consultant directly, and which feedback may include perspectives from the access supporter
* Enable a circle of caregivers to all be a part of the process and provide safety 
* Entities should be flexible in case consultants’ access needs have changed

### Use community facilitation

* Have facilitation come from someone that the consultants can relate to, or from their own community - this provides more authentic answers, and may help with consultants feeling pressured to say what they think federally regulated entities want to hear

### Federally regulated entities need to be flexible and transparent about their communication

* Federally regulated entities need to communicate to consultants through their preferred medium
* Federally regulated entities need to communicate the timeframe of when they’ll respond

### Federally regulated entities ask questions that meet the consultant where they’re at

* “How can I best serve you as your (bank, etc)?”
* “What annoys you?”
* “What makes you feel excluded when you walk into a business?”
* “What are you looking for, what do you need?”

### Have a neutral third party to be involved as process support

* Make sure safety and well-being of the consultants is met
* Conduct debrief with consultants to support them emotionally
* Ensure representative consultants are responsibly advocating for their constituency group
* Attempt to resolve a conflict before consultant leaves the process

### Develop follow-up plan together

* When follow up will happen
* What follow up will actually look like
* How they’re going to implement feedback
* Who is responsible for implementing feedback
* How to reach out for updates

### Representatives check in with their constituency group, and get actual quotes and comments to inform feedback given to entities
