  accessibility plan.

## Ideas

### Create opportunity for follow-up 

* Consultants come back here to look through what’s been done and offer feedback

### Organization updates consultants on follow up plan 

* Plan for how the organization will be implementing feedback
* Plan for how the organization is accountable for implementing feedback
* Provide transparency on any repercussions on not implementing feedback (ex. fines)

### Appreciate & celebrate consultants

* A way to affirm consultants that what they had to offer was valuable

### Data tracking

* How much of the consultants’ feedback made it into the accessibility plan
