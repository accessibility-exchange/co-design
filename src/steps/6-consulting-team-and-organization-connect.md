## Ideas

### Design the consultation together - how can organizations effectively enable the participation of consultants

* Organization has a conversation with the consultants about: 

  * How to best engage them
  * What makes them comfortable
  * What resources they need to be supported (ex. software licenses, note taking services,  support people, etc)
* Organizations can also do some of this work beforehand by asking community groups and nonprofits

### Work together to determine what happens if the feedback is interrupted for unforeseen reasons



### Provide detailed orientation of the project

* Making sure consultants are fully aware of:

  * The terms of participation
  * Timeframe
  * Goals
  * Responsibilities 
  * Other collaborators on the project
  * How their feedback will be acted upon

### Evaluate the “fit” between organization and consultant

* Based on this, the individual consultants can determine whether they are the best person for this project
* Organizations can (in some circumstances) identify that a consultant might not be appropriate for their project (ex. if there’s a conflict of interest)
