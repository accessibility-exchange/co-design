title: Organization shares rough draft for feedback
step: 8
phase: Consultation
subtitle: Consultants have another chance to look through a rough draft of the
  Accessibility Plan, and make sure nothing is missing.

## Ideas

### Create an opportunity for follow-up

* Consultants come back here to look through whatâ€™s been done and offer feedback

### Assessment criteria for quality of consultation

* Who was involved, and how many consultants
* Is the feedback comprehensive enough
* How much time was given for responses
* Are there any perspectives missing?
* This can be done by another group or panel with cross-disability perspective
