## Ideas

### Instead of federally regulated entities picking individual consultants, they should consult with a pre-assembled group or panel

* Need to ensure a diversity of perspectives that are:

  * Cross-disability
  * Intersectional
  * Cross-Canada
  * Both rural and urban representation
  * Directly impacted by the project
  * Intergenerational
* Mitigate the risk of federally regulated entities picking the same people or name brand charities who will approve their plan easily

### A way to make sure all the necessary perspectives are included on a consulting team

* Something like a committee to check
* These people also need to have broad lived experience of intersectional identities 
* Need to have training  

### Have someone (a “concierge”) look at the federally regulated entity’s needs and match them with a group of consultants

* Match needs to consider:

  * A federally regulated entity’s needs and areas they want to work on (Ex. policies, HR, etc.)
  * Where a federally regulated entity is at on their accessibility plan journey
  * Federally regulated entity’s disability awareness and how much education they still need (can talk to the training consultant about this)
  * Consultant's interest for certain federally regulated entities, experiences, and past work
* This person can help make sure projects are distributed equitably, not just going to those who appear more “qualified” than others
* Not put individuals and large professional charity representatives in one group
* This needs to be someone human, not an algorithm
* Can also help match younger consultants who want mentorship to experienced ones

### Consultants shouldn’t just be charities or self-appointed advocates who are not themselves Deaf or disabled

* Compensation needs to make its way back to the community itself

### Include access support people like a caregiver

* People who are already coming with their support person
* Authorized to support the person
* An ally or emotional support just for this process

### Consultants should be able to reach out to a specific federally regulated entity

* For example, if they’ve encountered a barrier in real life that they want to address with the federally regulated entity

### Avoid duplication

* Have entities be grouped to get feedback to avoid duplication
* Have the same consultants connect to multiple entities - especially in the same industry - to avoid duplication
* Consultants connect other consultants on projects similar to theirs to share knowledge
* Build off of previous work by entities in the same industry - leverage examples, templates, etc

### Data tracking

* Use data tracking to make sure consultants have even distribution of opportunities - make sure we capture intersectional data about the consultants
