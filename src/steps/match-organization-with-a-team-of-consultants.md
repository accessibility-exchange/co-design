## Ideas

### Instead of organizations picking individual consultants, they should consult with a pre-assembled group or panel

* Need to ensure a diversity of perspectives that are:

  * Cross-disability
  * Intersectional
  * Cross-Canada
  * Both rural and urban representation
  * Directly impacted by the project
  * Intergenerational
* Mitigate the risk of organizations picking the same people who will approve their plan easily

### A way to make sure all the necessary perspectives are included on a consulting team

* Something like a committee to check

### Have someone (a “concierge”) look at the organization’s needs and match them with a group of consultants

* Match needs to consider:

  * An organization’s needs
  * Where an organization is at on their accessibility plan journey
  * Organization’s disability awareness and how much education they still need
  * Consultant's interest for certain organizations
* This person can help make sure projects are distributed equitably, not just going to those who appear more “qualified” than others
* This needs to be someone human, not an algorithm
* Can also help match younger consultants who want mentorship to experienced ones

### Consultants shouldn’t just be charities or self-appointed advocates who are not themselves Deaf or disabled

* Compensation needs to make its way back to the community itself

### Include access support people like a caregiver

* People who are already coming with their support person
* Authorized to support the person
* An ally or emotional support just for this process

### Consultants should be able to reach out to a specific organization

* For example, if they’ve encountered a barrier in real life that they want to address with the organization

### Data tracking

* Use data tracking to make sure consultants have even distribution of opportunities - make sure we capture intersectional data about the consultants
