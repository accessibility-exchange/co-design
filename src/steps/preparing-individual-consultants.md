## Ideas

### Include both people with disabilities and caregivers

### Facilitate people’s identification of their skills and expertise

### Allow for many ways to share

* A classic resume and bio
* Sharing a story about their work, or impact they’ve made in their community, to demonstrate their expertise, ex. video

### Training the consultant

* How to not let others take advantage of them
* Learn from Indigenous culture ways to deal with people who may not understand them yet
* Learn how to be a consultant
* Learn about others’ disabilities and intersections

### Data tracking

* A transparent mechanism to track data of who is signing up, and which groups are underrepresented
