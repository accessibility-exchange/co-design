## Ideas

### Include both people with disabilities and caregivers

### Facilitate people’s identification of their skills and expertise

### Allow for many ways to share

* A classic resume and bio
* Sharing a story about their work, or impact they’ve made in their community, to demonstrate their expertise, ex. video

### Training the consultant

* Training on disability and intersectionality 

  * Anti-oppression
  * Decolonization
  * Disability Justice
  * Human rights
* Training on their employment and legal rights

  * What to look for in a contract
* Training on how to be a consultant

  * How to not speak on someone’s behalf, but raise issues in allyship
  * Best practices for collaboration - for example, from Indigenous culture
  * A way to manage anxiety and stress around being a consultant
  * How to identify your own boundaries, know what a safe and healthy interaction looks like, and be able to identify toxic behaviours

### Establish clear roles for the caregiver

* Be the liaison between the person they’re caring for and the entity - not talking on behalf of them
* Establish boundaries and ensure safety

### Data tracking

* A transparent mechanism to track data of who is signing up, and which groups are underrepresented
