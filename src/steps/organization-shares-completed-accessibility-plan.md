## Ideas

### Create opportunity for follow-up

* Consultants come back here to look through what’s been done and offer feedback
* Consultants can appeal the results, challenge it, or reject it

### Federally regulated entity updates consultants on follow up plan

* Plan for how the federally regulated entity will be implementing feedback
* Plan for how the federally regulated entity is accountable for implementing feedback
* Provide transparency on any repercussions on not implementing feedback (ex. fines)

### A way for all consultants to see the process that was taken and critique it

* Agree or disagree with the processes
* Point out gaps in perspectives

### Appreciate & celebrate consultants

* A way to affirm consultants that what they had to offer was valuable

### Connect consultants in a community of practice

* A way for different groups of consultants to come together after the completion of a project to share learnings and outcomes

### Data tracking

* How much of the consultants’ feedback made it into the accessibility plan
* Evaluate organization's knowledge around Deaf people and people with disabilities after the process
