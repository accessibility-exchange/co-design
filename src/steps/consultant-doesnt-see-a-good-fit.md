subtitle: Consultants determine whether they’re a good fit for the project after
  learning about it from the federally regulated entity
phase: Preparing together
step: 10.1

## Ideas

### Do an exit interview to understand where the mismatch was

* Understand from the consultant why they felt like this project wasn’t a good fit
* Alter matching process to take in this feedback

### Referral process for new projects or consultants

* Refer consultants to other projects based on similarities
* Refer the entity to other consultants

### Data tracking

* Keep track of who is leaving the process, and why
* Keep track of what sorts of projects consultants are leaving
* Use this data to improve matching or training for federally regulated entities
