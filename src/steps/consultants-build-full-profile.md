## Ideas

### Include a wide range of qualifications

* Expertise and skills
* Recent consultation work (including volunteer work)
* Areas of interest

### Include lived experience

* Sharing their identity intersections
* In which ways access matters to them
* Share their experience with different disabilities
* Where they live

### Access information and preferences

* Pace of working
* Communication needs (ex. reminders)
* Communication modes (ex. email, call)
* Their support person
* How they’d like to be compensated
* Any representative they trust to represent them
* Language they use
* Primary support person
* Emergency contacts
* If their profile was created by someone else (ex. a caregiver)

### Include consultant's goals

* Include what consultants would like to get out of this process
* Include a few examples to spur thinking
* Connect this back to area of interest (ex. policy, HR, etc)

### Specify if they’re representing a group

* Which group they represent
* Who makes up their constituency

### Facilitate profiles in multiple formats and languages

* Allow people to use multiple formats to explain the type of work they do, ex. video, audio, drawings, pictures - and offer support for them to produce these
* Allow people to use different languages to create their profile, ex. ASL, LSQ, ISL

### Allow people to express their expertise in out of the box ways

* Anything that demonstrates the work the consultants have done in the past
* For example: Past works, process pieces

### Give consultants the option to adjust privacy settings on any information they enter
