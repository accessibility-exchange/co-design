step: 6

## Ideas

### Evaluate how much knowledge federally regulated entities have around Deafness and disability

* Have a concierge to meet the federally regulated entities where they’re at, and provide what is needed to support them in their learning

### Federally regulated entities must go through some training about disability issues and cultural differences before engaging

* Review policies like the UN Convention of Persons with Disabilities, and other relevant policies (ex. anti audism policy, human rights code)
* Learn about the difficulties that Deaf people and people with disabilities face, and the advocacy that’s already been done (ex. Reconciliation for Indigenous communities)
* Be aware of any complaints the organization received  around accessibility - this can be done through storytelling about experiences with certain organizations
* Do training on how to work appropriately with different groups, ex. BIPOC training, accessibility training, sensitivity training
* If going into a community, do research work on how to do so respectfully

### Evaluate their readiness for change

* Federally regulated entities need to internally evaluate whether they are willing and ready to do accessibility work.
* There are models such as the Readiness for Change model that can be used.
* If they are not at the Preparation or Action stage, they need to do some more internal work

### Set clear expectations around collaboration

* Entities need to know what to expect in regards to resources they need to provide, and the timelines, working styles, communication styles,  and access needs of the community
* Always provide communication in multiple mediums and formats
* Entities need to know that this process is more partnership-based rather than hierarchical, using an anti-oppression approach
* Entities receive a guideline of appropriate behaviour with consultants
  Present non-negotiable fee structure for consultants 

### Setting clear expectations around outcomes

* Federally regulated entities need to have a realistic sense of what they can achieve in a set timeframe

### Be transparent about their work

* Federally regulated entities should be transparent about their vision, mission, process, and what they’re willing to change or do

### Have a designated person or team to steward the process

* Federally regulated entities need to have a person or a team responsible for planning for the future, budgeting for accessibility supports, planning ongoing consultation, taking feedback, and making decisions based on feedback
* This person would preferably also be someone Deaf or with a disability
* If this person doesn’t have lived experience, consider having:

  * an advisory group with lived experiences of disability 
  * a contractor who is an accessibility specialist

### Provide resources for these organizations

* We can provide a basic resource on how to meet different access needs
* Have case studies or peer sharing from other groups on what they’re doing to engage with Deaf people and People wtih Disabilities effectively
* Provide previous insights and best practices, especially in their particular industry
* A glossary of terms helps entities use the appropriate terms when referring to consultant's abilities
* Have consultants on the website willing to help do this prep work with organizations, and coach them in reaching out
