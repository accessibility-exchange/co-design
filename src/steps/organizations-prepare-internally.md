## Ideas

### Evaluate how much organizational knowledge you have around Deafness and disability

* Have a concierge to meet the organizations where  they’re at, and provide what is needed to support them in their learning

### Evaluate their readiness for change

* Organizations need to internally evaluate whether they are willing and ready to do accessibility work.
* There are models such as the Readiness for Change model that can be used.
* If they are not at the Preparation or Action stage, they need to do some more internal work

### Organizations must go through some training about disability issues before engaging

* Review policies like the UN Convention of Persons with Disabilities, and other relevant policies (ex. anti audism policy)
* Learn about the difficulties that Deaf people and people with disabilities face, and the advocacy that’s already been done
* Be aware of any complaints the organization received  around accessibility - this can be done through storytelling about experiences with certain organizations

### Set clear expectations around collaboration

* Organizations need to know what to expect in regards to resources they need to provide, and the timelines, working styles, and access needs of the community

### Setting clear expectations around outcomes

* Organizations need to have a realistic sense of what they can achieve in a set timeframe

### Be transparent about their work

* Organizations should be transparent about their vision, mission, process, and what they’re willing to change or do

### Have a designated person or team to steward the process

* Organizations need to have a person or a team responsible for planning for the future, budgeting for accessibility supports, planning ongoing consultation, taking feedback, and making decisions based on feedback
* This person would preferably also be someone Deaf or with a disability
