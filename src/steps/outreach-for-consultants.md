## Ideas

### Spread general awareness through multiple channels

* Social media
* News outlets
* Advertisements
* Surveys
* Community newsletters
* Campaigns

### Reach out through community groups and federally regulated entities

* Nonprofits
* Community groups
* Community health centres
* Independent living centres
* Mental health orgs
* Advocacy groups
* Whatever people are already connected to

### Find qualified outreach team members

* Have deep knowledge of cross-disability and intersectionality to make sure there is equitable representation on the website
* Use data gathering to find out which communities are still under-represented
* Be embedded in a certain community, and has a sense of what people have to offer even if the individual may not think so
* Reach out to the marginalized groups within marginalized groups (ex. queer seniors, two spirit people, asexual people)
* Have an understanding that not everyone has the same resources, or methods of connecting

### Build a relationship

* Having a presence in the community
* Having workshops or meetings as a way of getting input and building awareness
* Letting community know this website and these consulting opportunities are available
* Share how they can contribute
* Answer any questions

### Address internalized attitudes about consulting

* Some communities have internalized beliefs about who consultants are
* Break down what a “consultant” is and does
* Be aware to not use language that creates these internalized barriers

### Build constituency groups

* Build a community of people who would prefer for someone to represent them
* This constituency group needs to be representative of the diversity of the larger community
* Find people who are willing to be representatives of this group
