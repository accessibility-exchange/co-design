## Ideas

### Spread general awareness through multiple channels

* Social media
* News outlets
* Advertisements
* Surveys
* Community newsletters
* Campaigns
* In-community settings (ex. the park, community centre, etc)

### Reach out through community groups and federally regulated entities

* Nonprofits
* Community groups
* Community health centres
* Independent living centres
* Mental health orgs
* Advocacy groups
* Whatever people are already connected to
* Independent facilitators for people with significant disabilities
* Elders in Indigenous communities

### Find qualified outreach team members

* Have lived experience of Deaf or disability
* Have deep knowledge of cross-disability and intersectionality to make sure there is equitable representation on the website
* Be embedded in a certain community, and has a sense of what people have to offer even if the individual may not think so
* Have an understanding that not everyone has the same resources, or methods of connecting
* Have multiple community members doing outreach in one community to cover more diversity

### Build a relationship

* Having a presence in the community
* Having workshops or meetings as a way of getting input and building awareness
* Letting community know this website and these consulting opportunities are available
* General walkthrough of the consulting process
* Share how they can contribute
* Answer any questions


### Address internalized attitudes about consulting

* Some communities have internalized beliefs about who consultants are
* Break down what a “consultant” is and does
* Be aware to not use language that creates these internalized barriers

### Who to reach out to

* Use data gathering to find out which communities are still under-represented
* Marginalized groups within marginalized groups (ex. queer seniors, two spirit people, asexual people)
* People who may not consider themselves as having a disability, like seniors
* Community members who have an informed perspective about disability, in addition to lived experience
* People who might be the users of a service/customers of that organization
* People who could use mentorship from more experienced consultants

### Build constituency groups

* Build a community of people who would prefer for someone to represent them
* This constituency group needs to be representative of the diversity of the larger community
* Find people who are willing to be representatives of this group
