title: 6.1 Consultants exit process
subtitle: If a consultant and organization realizes they are not a good fit, the
  consultant exits the process.

## Ideas

### Data tracking

* Keep track of who is leaving the process, and why
* Keep track of what sorts of projects consultants are leaving
* Use this data to improve matching or training for organizations

### Have a process supporter troubleshoot before an exit happens

* Neutral third party, like a project manager, to resolve the situation if possible
