## Ideas

### Be transparent about whatâ€™s on the website

* What kinds of projects are on the website
* Who are the other consultants
* A list of key terms  that are not already in clear language
* A list of roles and their expectations in clear language. For example:

  * who you are offering services to?
  * who do you want to access the service from?
  * who is available to support your participation?

### An opportunity for consultants to ask questions about this process, and how the website works
