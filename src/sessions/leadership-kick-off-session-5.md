On behalf of the facilitation team, we are eagerly awaiting the discussions for our 5th AIA Kick-Off Session happening this Monday!

We have enclosed the materials for your review, which include the slide decks and synthesis report. If folks do not have an opportunity to review these, we will allocate time to talk through them during the session.
